## ABOUT THE PROJECT

**!!! Forge Config API Port is in no way affiliated with the Forge project !!!**

**The sole purpose of this library is to enable usage of the Forge config api on the Fabric mod loader. This is done in
the hopes of removing one more obstacle for developers wishing to maintain their mods on both loaders.**

This is a direct port from Forge, all package names are the same, so you don't even have to readjust imports when
porting from Forge.
As Fabric is a whole different mod loader, there obviously have to be some differences, even though they're quite small.

## DEVELOPER INFORMATION

### Adding to your workspace

This project is still in development. Implementing it in your workspace is not yet recommended. Therefore, no maven
repository exists at the moment.

#### Adding Forge Config API Port via the Curse Maven

In case you're eager to test this project, it can be included via the Curse Maven (Note: project name is merely a
descriptor, you should be able to choose it freely; project id is found in the info box of a project page, file id is
found at the end of the file url). This is how adding a Curse Maven dependency is generally done:

```groovy
repositories {
	maven { url = "https://cursemaven.com" }
}

dependencies {
    	modImplementation "curse.maven:<projectName>-<projectId>:<fileId>"
}
```

#### Manually adding Night Config dependencies via Maven

Since the Curse Maven generally isn't aware of any maven dependencies, you might have to add those manually, too. They
are only required within your workspace, in a production environment those dependencies are shipped with Forge Config
API Port.

```groovy
repositories {
    	mavenCentral()
}

dependencies {
	implementation 'com.electronwill.night-config:core:3.6.3'
	implementation 'com.electronwill.night-config:toml:3.6.3'
}
```

#### Adding dependency overrides for Night Config mods

There's also one more thing that might have to be done: Depending on how you have enabled Forge Config API Port in your
environment, the mod might not be able to recognize the required Night Config libraries. You'll know that is the case
when upon running the game instance, you'll be greeted by this message:

```
 net.fabricmc.loader.impl.FormattedException: net.fabricmc.loader.impl.discovery.ModResolutionException: Mod resolution encountered an incompatible mod set!
A potential solution has been determined:
	 - Install com_electronwill_night-config_core, any version.
	 - Install com_electronwill_night-config_toml, any version.
```

To resolve this issue, what you need to do is add dependency overrides (check
the [Fabric Wiki](https://fabricmc.net/wiki/tutorial:dependency_overrides) for more information on this topic) for your
configuration. Do that by creating a new file at `run/config/fabric_loader_dependencies.json`, in which you put the
following contents:

```json
{
  "version": 1,
  "overrides": {
    "forgeconfigapiport": {
      "-depends": {
        "com_electronwill_night-config_core": "",
        "com_electronwill_night-config_toml": ""
      }
    }
  }
}
```

Also don't forget to manually add this file to your VCS, since the whole `run` directory is usually ignored by default.

### Working with Forge Config API Port

#### Registering configs

The recommended point for registering your configs is directly in your `ModInitializer::onInitialize` method.

Registering your configs still works via a class called `net.minecraftforge.api.ModLoadingContext`, though the name is
only for mimicking Forge, as this is really only used for registering configs.

You'll have to provide the mod id of your mod, as there is no context which would be aware of the current mod.

```java
public static void registerConfig(String modId, ModConfig.Type type, IConfigSpec<?> spec)
```

And as on Forge there is also a version which supports a custom file name.

```java
public static void registerConfig(String modId, ModConfig.Type type, IConfigSpec<?> spec, String fileName)
```

#### Config loading

As Forge's mod loading process is split into multiple stages, configs aren't loaded immediately upon being registered.
On Fabric though, no such mod loading stages exist. Therefore, Forge Config API Port loads all registered configs
immediately.

#### Listening for config loading and reloading

Forge's `ModConfigEvent.Loading` and `ModConfigEvent.Reloading` events are both adapted for Fabric's callback event
style. They can be accessed from the `net.minecraftforge.api.fml.event.config.ModConfigEvent` class.

As on Forge, all these events provide is the config that is loading / reloading. But unlike on Forge, when processing
that config, you'll have to make sure it actually comes from your mod. This is important, as there is no mod specific
event bus on Fabric, meaning all events are fired for all mods subscribed to them.

As an example, a complete implementation of the reloading callback looks something like this:

```java
ModConfigEvent.RELOADING.register((ModConfig config) -> {
    if (config.getModId().equals(<modId>)) {
        ...
    }
});
```
